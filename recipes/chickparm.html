        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Make tomato sauce: Heat oil and garlic in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until garlic starts to sizzle. Stir in tomatoes, basil, oregano, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. Brong to a simmer; cook until sauce slightly thickens and flavors meld, 10 to 12 minutes. Cover and keep warm.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p> Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook sphagettin in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Make chicken cutlets: Lay chicken pieces between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or heavy pan to pound chicken to about 1/4-inch thickness.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>Beat egg in a shallow dish until well blended. Season bread crumbs with black pepper in another shallow dish</p>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
            <p>Preheat the oven broiler to high. Place a rack 4 to 6 inches from the heat source.</p>    
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
            <p>Woking with one cutlet at a time, dip chicken in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. Lay breaded cutlets on a wire rack set over a cookie sheet.</p>    
            <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
            <p>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
            <p>Fry breaded cutlets in hot oil until golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes total. Wash and dry the wire rack and return to the cookie sheet. Place fried cutlets on the clean wire rack.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 9</strong></li>
            <p>Top each cutlet with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Broil until chesse melts and is spotty brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 10</strong></li>
            <p>Portion the pasta onto 4 plates and top each with a chicken cutlet. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons tomato sauce over each cutlet, then sauce pasta as desired. Serve with extra Parmesan at the table</p>
