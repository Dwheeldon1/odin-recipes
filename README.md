# odin-recipes

 This is my First Odin project. Creating a website to display recipes, each 
using separate pages. So far I have had to look up how to make repositories 
in Github again. I have taken a class on building websites but I did not
get much explanation on how things worked in that class. 
 
 This project starts having me use git, the linux CLI together which will be 
needed further down the line as I progress in this career.This project also
will show that I can use HTML to establish a basic frame for a project. I 
will also be using tags for images, and relative links it will also show that
I can use unordered and ordered lists. I will also be using git commit 
messages to explain what I changed.
